# ETI300W - Enterprise Web Platforms & Cloud Computing
This was a group project for my ETI (Enterprise Technology Integration) 300 Course, which is a cloud computing technologies course. We used a 3-tiered server system, with a MongoDB, web API, and a front-end server all hosted using MongoDB Atlas & AWS. <br>
My group and I decided on a LAMP stack at first, but switched to a MEAN approach last minute. The only thing changed was that instead of using Angular, we used Bootstrap and jQuery, which were much more familiar.
